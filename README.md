my name is heaven/hell or you can call me by either: my older names or wtv you want.. ^_^
im a little shy, so i just lurk around the hetalia area hoping 4 an interaction.. but interactions are welcome aru! 
tho if i don't respond, i'm likely busy. (sorry! im not trying to ignore anyone aru TT)

i love rochu and kinda see myself as wang yao. (sometimes ivan braginsky) : )

byf/ im quite shy and awkward if we first interact, and i start to  ramble alot when i get comfortable aru! also, i do not use tonetags, please lmk if you want me to use them. : ) 

dni/ basic dni, proship/darkshippers, (hetalia specific: usuk/itacest/caname shippers, sorry i get a little uncomfortable at the mention of these ships. :( (and also, not necessarily unallowed to interact, but
